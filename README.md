# LAB12
This lab uses the Cv library and allows us to access the Camera functions using the PI


In the first part of the lab we make a program that will allowed us to open a image file from our Pi and display it in a box on the screen

The second program we open our camera and display the image on screen using the Cv video capture

The third program will blend two pictures using the add weight funmction to one of the pictures and displaying them together

the 4th program 


The 6th program will detect a human face and eyes.

In conclusion these would be very usefull for someone who needs to inturpret imagines or is using a camera in their project. You could use it also to relate an image to a certian amount of information in a data base. Which could create a smart Photo reconigition data base.
